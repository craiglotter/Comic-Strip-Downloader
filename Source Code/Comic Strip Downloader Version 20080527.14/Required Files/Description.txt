Comic Strip Downloader

Comic Strip Downloader monitors the URLs you inputted on a hourly basis, checking for image files matching your inputted file mask and then downloading any matches should they not already be downloaded on your system. You can also force the download should you not wish to wait for the download cycle to begin automatically.
